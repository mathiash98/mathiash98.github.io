# 2023 September

Yet another month is over and it's time to recap what I've been up to!

Looking back on the month I am unsure what I have done haha, so it's nice to check the calendar and Daylio.

I watched Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back in Grieghallen with live orcestra, that was nice! And I also attended an alternative concert at the Griegacademy with modernistic classic music, that was also nice! Then I attended Kakkmaddafakka concert, despite the name they do not play punk music, they play excellent pop music.

What is a month without some travelling? I spent 6 days in Paris! Paris is good, full of delicious food and faboulus turistic attractions. I would really recommend visiting Arc de Triumphe instead of the Eiffel Tower, less people, cheaper and better views. And then you should of course visit Le Louvre, not to see Mona Lisa but to look at the people waiting in line for taking a picture with Mona Lisa. Le Louvre is the best museum I have been to, every room is different and the ceiling height is like 10m with roof paintings in all! They even have a mini egyptian sphinx in the basement. But Paris is not better than Copenhagen!

## Monthly principle

    "If something takes less than 5 minutes, just do it now."

It's a nice habit to build, even though I don't always follow it. But it's nice remind myself of the principle sometimes.

## Notable reads

Subscribing to the [hackernews RSS feed](https://news.ycombinator.com/) provides me with loads of interesting articles. This month I found this very interesting article; [Don't mess with a genius](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/dont-mess-with-a-genius/). It tells the story about sir Isaac Newton's career as "Warden of the mint". In this position he brought down the money counterfeiter William Chaloner. It's a very interesting read and I would recommend it to anyone.

## Finances & spendings

Seems like the global market has decreased some percentages in value as my investments was down around 3% this month.

September was not as expensive as last month as I lived for free in Paris, just paid for food. So my spendings went from more than 30k NOK down to just 11k NOK.

## Work life

It's still very fun to see how quickly the 3 junior developers develop. And their progress is very good. Sadly one of them was fired because of cost reduction in the company, but I am sure he will find a new job quickly. Especially when we send a letter of recommendation.

## Personal projects

My living room is now fully painted! Other than that I have not done much on my personal projects this month either.

## Daylio recap

Average happiness 4.2/5.0 and increase by 0.1!
