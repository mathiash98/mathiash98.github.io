# 2023 July

July has been a nice month with vacationing and hanging out with friends. I have also finally been able to work on personal projects again, which is great.

## Finances

July was pretty good and overall my net worth excluding my apartment increased by around 5%.
I am still a fan of last month decision to sell all my index funds and buy forex secured index fund. To track the difference in performance I purchased a small amount in the similar index fund but not secured. So far the secured fund has increased by 2.8% while the not secured has increased by 1.9%. Pretty decent extra ROI.

### Spendings & cash flow

July ended up as a pretty average month because of shoes and purchase of paint for my apartment. I also did not pay anything on my loan this month as I switched from SpareBanken Vest to Bulder Bank which ironically is fully owned by SpareBanken Vest. Bulder is their digital concept with large focus on app and automatic interest adjustments. I am still happy with the decision as the interest is around 0.2% lower than what I had, and I got to merge my two loans into one.

## Work life

Most of the month was spent on vacation. The days spent on work was mostly spent on bugs and planning tasks for the new junior developers that will start in August.

## Personal projects

As vacations strangely are filled with time available, I was finally able to build the trail map generator I wanted to build last year, [see my blog post about it here](/posts/trail-map-generator).

I also spent some time doing OSS contributions to [vue3-openlayers](https://github.com/MelihAltintas/vue3-openlayers/pull/211) and [OpenInfraMap](https://github.com/openinframap/openinframap).

- Average mood was 3.9/5 mostly affected by the flu I had the last week of July.
- I have been hanging out with friends in the sun a lot which is great. Last part of July was a bit more cloudy and rainy with a small flu, but still nice.
- Overall a good month with a lot of sun and friends.
