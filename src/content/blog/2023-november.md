# 2023 November

Yet another month has passed and it's time to recap what I've been doing!

## Monthly principle üåü

> Write meeting notes, documentations, questions, answers, etc. in public searchable spaces.

- This is something I have seen an increasing need for in my daily work life, you can read more about why in my blogpost [Value of transparent notes](/posts/2023-11-value-of-transparent-notes).

## Finances üí∞

My networth increased by 12.5% in November! Both crypty and stocks are even more up.

### Spendings & cash flow üí∏

Data is not ready yet.

## Work life üë®‚Äçüíª

At work we are initiating a couple of new projects which is fun.

- Releasing the Generic Dashboard feature, essentially a Grafana clone integrated into the UI. Enables us to quickly build custom dashboards for customers.
- Moving away from PDF user manuals and instead use a web based solution. To generate the web page I am using Vitepress, a SSG with support for Vue and a pretty docs theme from start. The docs are hosted on GitHub pages and the CI/CD is done with GitHub actions. This works quite well and it even has an experimental integration with Chad Gee Pee Tee The Third through an excellent small plugin: https://github.com/AirCodeLabs/documate, so you can chat about the user manual.

## Personal projects ü§ñ

At the start of the month i joined friByte in organising Bergen Open Source, that was fun, and I got to speak about OpenStreetMap. You can see my talk here https://boskonf.no/arkiv/2023/.

Other than that I have started experimenting with AI, so there will probably be some blog posts the coming months. My first idea is to make a simple game where you interact with AIs around the world. But they have context of what you have done, what you are wearing etc. So if you are wearing a red shirt, the AI might say "I like your red shirt", or if you have a beard, the AI might say "I like your beard". The AI will also have a personality, so some might be more friendly than others. They will also have memory, so if you have interacted with the AI before, it will remember you and what you have done. I think that will be pretty cool.

This month I hosted 2 dinner parties with friends, first sushi, then Pinnekj√∏tt. Both were very nice and I sort of plan to host a dinner party every second week where I try to invite different people each time. I think that will be a nice way to meet new people and have fun.

## Daylio recap üìä

Average happiness 3.9/5.0 a decrease by 0.1.

- Overall a good month with quality time with friends and time for programming. But I have been feeling tired many days, so I think I need to focus more on getting enough sleep.
