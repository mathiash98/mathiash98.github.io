But is it rational to buy rounds?

# How to measure rationality

## Microeconomics

Rational humans will only buy something if the marginal utility is higher than the marginal cost.

## Game theory

In a game theory perspective, buying rounds can be seen as a social contract. If you don't buy a round, you might not get a drink back.
But what if you are smart and indicate that you will buy a round and then suddenly the night is over and you have bought nothing are are 5 beers up?

# Building a formula

Let's put away game theory for a while and focus on the economics of buying a round.
So the marginal utility needs to be higher than the cost, let's list some factors:

- The cost of the round
- Your benefit of the one beer you drink
- The benefit each of your friends get from the beer
  - This is hard to measure, but let's say it's around the same as your benefit, unless we are very late in the night
- The value of probono activity of donating to your poor friends

| Factor                    | Cost per unit                                                         | Total  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Cost of the round         |                                                                       | $10    |
| Your benefit              | The enjoyment or satisfaction you get from drinking one beer          | High   |
| Friends' benefit          | The enjoyment or satisfaction your friends get from drinking one beer | Medium |
| Value of probono activity | The value you place on being generous and helping out your friends    | $5     |
