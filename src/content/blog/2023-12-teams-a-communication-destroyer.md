# Separating DM chat and team channel chat

# Hard to identify where new messages are

# Team channels are not chats, they are facebook feeds

## Posts in team channels are too bulky

Which increase the risk of people not reading messages which are more than 4 messages old

# Not possible to tag people outside of the current chat window
